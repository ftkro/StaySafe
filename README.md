## Proposed policy
From Takuro
- Use GitHub Actions to perform automated code analysis
- Use GitHub Actions to build, test, cache and possibly deploy artifact automatically
- Do not commit file to main branch, but use pull request otherwise discussed (Unless initial few steps)
- Do not commit too much as it will increase repo size and bombarding my mailbox plus I might have to pay overage fee for GitHub Actions.
- Do not commit > 10 MB file. If it is truly necessary, use Git LFS.
- Use GPG sign during commit process, if you familiar with it
